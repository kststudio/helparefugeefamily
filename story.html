                    <p>Today you’re going to see a lot of smiles in pictures, but heartbreak in words. They smile not because they’re happy with their lives, but because if there is one thing you see in children during crisis, it is their unbelievable resilience. It’s contagious. A picture can capture a desperate moment and make you feel the humanity, and a smile can capture a moment that reassures you they’re just fine. What I hope you will understand after you hear their story and read about their journey is that these people have survived and will continue to survive. If I have anything to do with it, and I hope you feel the same thing too, with our help, they will thrive.</p>

<p>We’re here to help 15 children in this world that have experienced and suffered more in their short lives than most of us will ever know in our whole lives.</p>

<p>In August 2015, the first members of my family joined the refugee migration. My uncle packed up what he could in a backpack and began his journey with his 4 children and his wife, headed towards Germany. They lived through 12 days of uncertainty, eventually reaching their destination. Their journey included a trip across Turkish waters in the middle of the night into Greece. They continued their travels through Greece, Macedonia, and Serbia by any means available, sometimes walking for miles and hours. Before Hungary aggressively closed their borders, they traveled through the country, getting stranded for days in the streets before eventually paying another smuggler to hide them in the back of a box truck with several others where temperatures were dangerously high. What they experienced is beyond words, but undoubtedly something they will never forget.</p>

<p>They have reached Germany and await housing and asylum in a basketball stadium set up for about 300 refugees, but spend every day learning the language and exploring their new homeland, preparing for the green light to build their new lives.</p>

<p>While the Syrian war continued to be extremely dangerous and volatile, there were still members of my family struggling with the decision to make the journey. Feras had paved the way, but it was was my aunt who struggled the most.</p>

<p>Muna has 7 children. In addition to having 7 children, 6 of which are young girls, her husband was arrested, tortured, and died in the custody of the Syrian Regime as a result of the most inhumane treatment you could ever hear in your life. For what? For helping innocent people. The details of his death are not just extremely horrifying and graphic, but more than anything, gut wrenching and heartbreaking.</p>

<p>She had to make a choice. To stay in a war zone where she witnessed first hand every single day what could be the fate of her children, or to take the risk and provide not just a better future, but any future for them at all. She made the decision to go, but not before adopting the neighbor’s daughter and offering a better future for her, too. With 8 children, she crossed the Syrian border and made her way to Turkey where she would meet up with another uncle, his wife and 3 children, and his brother in law who came for support and to map the journey so he could bring his own family.</p>

<p>Hasan faced an extreme adversity, as well. His 3-year-old daughter Ayah has a rare disorder that has left her handicapped and intellectually disabled. He would not only have to risk the stressors of the journey, but expose her to whatever unexpected situations they may face as well. He ended up carrying her nearly the entire way.</p>

<p>Their journey would take them 12 days as well, and across nearly 2,000 miles. Difficulties on their journey brought me to Croatia where I searched for 2 days. I drove across Croatia, Slovenia, and Austria to locate them. Along the way, I saw things I wish I didn’t have to see. I realized how unprepared Europe is for this crisis; the lack of urgency and communication between the countries has left all of the difficulties to fall on the backs of the refugees.</p>

<p>That was, until I reached Austria. The Austrian people that I came across were incredibly empathetic, compassionate, and kind. I met with my family in a camp in the south of Austria where they would have their first meal and hot showers.</p>

<p>Our reunion was emotional and I spent a day and a half just sitting with them, giving them a minute to be comfortable as they hadn’t slept indoors in nearly 2 weeks. It had been exactly 6 years since my last visit. I picked up where I always left off, with my Aunt who was always a mother to me during my visits to Syria before she became a mother herself. I spent a lot of time hugging my cousins, playing with them, and talking to them. If I could do nothing else, I was going to bring them love. In the few days I was there, I bonded with them and was astounded by their resilience. They have nothing and yet my 14-year-old cousin Afraa gifted me the bracelet on her wrist; the only thing she had that was hers. Their innocence finds them on an adventure where they’re seeing new things, experiencing different scenery and climates, bus rides and train rides. I was fascinated by their reaction to water. One of the most terrifying moments of their journey was back in Greece, where they got on a dinghy made for 25 people that was piled with nearly 50, an experience that would leave many fearful of water for the rest of their lives. As I rode the train with them, we passed a body of water, and every single one of them looked out the window and spoke with excitement about its beauty.</p>

<p>The time I spent in the camp was not just spent with them. I also talked with the organizers and volunteers who clued me in on some of the logistics, while also communicating with people I had met along the way. With all these little snippets of information, I created a game plan; one that would get them as close to the German border as I could get them, if not across without risking my life. That’s how we ended up on a train where they would sit comfortably with food and coloring books, quite unlike their journey from Croatia to Austria, where they boarded a cargo train and stood for nearly 7 hours. I was going to get them as far as I could.</p>

<p>We finally arrived in Szalsburg, right over the German border in Austria, where a bus waited for refugees to bring them to another camp. At the next camp, they would be placed in a queue in which they could be made to wait for nearly a week.. It was then that I used my voice, as loudly as I could, to get them to Germany. It was there that I saw how tired they were, how defeated they were, and how sick all the children were getting. After spending 3 hours with them in their “migration,” I realized that they had had enough. Everyone else in the camp was suffering too, that couldn’t be more true, but all attachments aside, there were 11 children who were suffering, Ayah most of all. Moving to another camp wasn’t suitable for her; they were extremely over-crowded. Putting her and those children in a transit camp in that city would have been inhumane by any standards. </p>

<p>I will tell the story in its entirety someday, but it was there that I used my resources and contacted an advocate I had met along the way to communicate with the police and keep them in the train station from which they could be sent to Germany. It was there that I would scream and cry for them. It was there where I would nearly get arrested for standing up for them. It was there that they would be reminded that these refugees are human beings and there were people that cared for them enough to fly across the world in their hardest moments.</p>

<p>It was in Szalsburg, Austria where I encountered a man with enough heart to stand up for my family; to risk his own job as a police officer and not only hear what I was saying, but stand up to his superior and take my family off that bus. He had them seem by the military medical staff, made space for them in a camp set up underground in the train station, and saw them onto the next train to Germany.</p>

<p>It was there that my family spent their last night running from the War in Syria.</p>

<p>Their journey is hardly over, but they are safe, and this is where I make my real contribution as an American Citizen. If we cannot take them into our country, all political beliefs aside, I will send my help to them.</p>

<p>A lot of humanitarian aid groups are doing amazing things for refugees during their migration. Pop-up camps along the way offer food, water, and shelter, groups have donated carriages for people like my uncle who are carrying their children. However, in a bid to help families get the necessities they need once they are processed, in housing, and able to look for work, I begin with my own family.</p>

<p>These are 3 families in need. Donate today to help these families get what they need to start their new lives as first generation Syrian-Germans after surviving not only war, but the largest migration crisis since World War II. These children deserve to have a home. Let’s help them get there.</p>
